If you haven't played the original Hollow Knight, Stop reading this and do that.

## The Bug Knight Features

* A new character, The Bug Knight

* A "dynamic character model feature" which will change the player appearance if you fully build into some deck archetypes.

* Animated enemies and unique attack animations for the player

* 5 levels of unlockables for the character

* Over 80 Unique character cards many with custom sound effects

* 3 unique monster encounters with fan favorite enemies with custom sounds and animations

* 2* new possibly balanced elite monster encounters with custom sounds and animations

* 3 new potentially balanced Boss Monster encounters custom sounds and animation

Note: Currently the enemy encounters are NOT restricted to just the Bug Knight character, if you don't want to face these bugs on other characters, I reccomend disabling the Bug Knight Mod for those runs.

* 9 new relics, 7 of them char specific.

* 1 new encounter, with a secret follow up encounter that will VERY rarely spawn (0.3% chance to see it)

* lots of bugs, both intentional and otherwise, hopefully less of the latter.

* 5 diverse deck archetypes which can mostly be mixed together: Soul, Infection, Void, Ally, Nailmaster.
