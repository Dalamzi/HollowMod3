**Hollow Mod**

So this is an overview of what the mod is, any design goals and a way to keep track of future plans. I guess.

The Goal is, of course, to integrate the world of Hollow Knight, by Team Cherry. into the world of Slay the Spire, in a way that doesn't completely ruin either experience or memory, since both are fantastic games. Additionaly it's a fun ay for me to brush up on my 6 years out of date java skills.

Hollow Mod currently has 4 Archetypes, although most of those also support hybrid decks pretty well (with the exception of Soul and Void)Currently Archetype API isn't supported but I want to eventually.

**Pure Vessel:** Focused on Soul, Spells and some healing. This probably is the default archetype, and has more cards than the others 

**Void God:** Void spells are powerful cards that instead of costong soul, apply VOID to you, void increases the damage of void cards even more, but also increases all damage you receive: Beware of birds.

**Broken Vessel:** Infection, and themed off the idea of a Vessel becoming corrupted like the Broken Vessel. Infection is a poison heavy build, but these cards also inflict Enfection on you, which is kinda like a self poison. but you can block the damage, so as long as you keep it balanced you are good.

**Friendship:** Ally cards are all sorts of benefits and buffs that help you out, this archtype relies more on the generic combat cards and doesn't have too many special mechanics.

In addition to these, you can interchange them pretty freely, infection and soul actually play off each other pretty well, and so does void and allies

Other Notes: Lifeblood is just temporary hp, unfortunately i don't know how to override the temporary HP bar aspect to make it look blue. I'll look into that as long as i can make sure it only happens to the knight. Lifeblood really isn't an archetype. It's just a defensive buff that helps out a lot.

* in leiu of that: I'm tempted to make a Zote. 
* Potential Zote Relic: "All Zote's attack Cards Say they do 200% their actual damage"

Re: Hollow Knight. Just to cover all the checkboxes here. If you haven't played Hollow knight, go buy it and play it,  It's easily one of the best Metroidvania games ever made. Team Cherry have always been some of the best Devs and absolutely have given their players their best without nickeling and diming them at all. (I mean, 4 DLC packs that almost double or triple the game length, for free?) 

Hopefully if I ever actually put this on steam, it doesn't "bug" them too much. https://hollowknight.com/ if you somehow download this and like it but didn't play hollow knight, all the art is from hollow knight and it's gorgeous. I can't talk it up enough.
